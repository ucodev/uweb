uWeb is an MVC framework written in PHP, similar to other common low-footprint frameworks in its structure.

It was written from scratch, and designed to be used as a RESTful Gateway API, easily integrated with event driven interfaces, and detailed and comprehesive logging with native interfaces for ELK stacks.
