uWeb is an MVC framework written in PHP, similar to other common low-footprint frameworks in its structure.

It was written from scratch, and designed to be used as a RESTful Gateway API, easily integrated with event driven interfaces, and detailed and comprehesive logging with native interfaces for ELK stacks.

Here is the base structure to get started:

* /application - where the models, controllers and views of the project applications reside.
* /system      - The core models, controllers and default configuration of the uWeb framework.
* /user        - Custom user extensions and user-defined configuration overlays.
